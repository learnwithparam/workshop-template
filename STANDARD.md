# The workshop standard

Every learnwithparam course repo starts from this template and follows these rules. Each rule is a check:
`bun run check` runs them all, CI runs it on every push, and a rule with no check does not count.
The research behind each rule is in the curriculum repo under `workshop-standard/research/`.

## Shape

```
README.md                run the finished system first, then how the course works
00-orientation/          setup, meet the world, see the goal; troubleshooting.md
world/                   the business: its data, its system of record, its app
parts/NN-<verb-thing>/   README.md: the problem, its cost, a Mermaid diagram
  NN-<verb-thing>/       one step: one problem, one outcome, one check
    step.toml            minutes, screen
    problem/             README.md and the starter; the learner works here
    solution/            the sample answer; CI proves the check passes on it
    wrong/<mistake>/     at least one common mistake; CI proves the check rejects it
    images/expected.png  the expected result, for any step with something on screen
checks/<step-name>.ts    the rules for one step
config/models.ts         the only file that names a model
schedules.toml           parts mapped onto formats
```

## Rules and the check behind each

| Rule | Check | Learned from |
|---|---|---|
| No Makefile. Commands are Bun or `uv run` scripts. | `check.ts` 1 | user, 12 Nov 2026 |
| A step is named verb-thing and the learner types that name: `bun run verify <step-name>`. Never a number. | `check.ts` 2, 3 | epicshop issue #184, numbered steps break on reorder |
| Plain English: no em dash, no hype word, no week, day or hour in content. | `check.ts` 2 | RESEARCH.md |
| Every part README has a Mermaid diagram and a Walkthrough section with its commands. | `check.ts` 3 | RESEARCH.md, user 12 Nov 2026 |
| The root README shows the finished system as a screenshot and a Mermaid diagram; the orientation shows a screenshot. | `check.ts` 2b | user 12 Nov 2026 |
| Every step shows a picture: a screenshot or a Mermaid diagram. | `check.ts` 3 | user 12 Nov 2026 |
| Every image a page names exists. | `check.ts` 2b | user 12 Nov 2026 |
| Every step README has: The problem, Your challenge, Done when, If you get stuck, Words you will use. | `check.ts` 3 | epicshop, Carpentries |
| A step takes 5 to 30 minutes and its README stays under 600 words. Split, never squeeze. | `check.ts` 3 | epicshop step sizes |
| A step whose result is on screen ships `images/expected.png` and shows it. | `check.ts` 3 | Langfuse workshop learner docs |
| The check fails on the starter, fails on every wrong answer, and passes on the solution. | `verify.ts --all` | Rustlings, freeCodeCamp #70626 and #67904 |
| Every failing rule prints a try-next sentence. | `verify.ts --all` | Exercism, mcp-fundamentals |
| Pass, fail and error exit 0, 1 and 2. Progress is recomputed from the checks every run. | `verify.ts` | GitHub Skills stuck learners, Oct 2026 |
| `bun run verify --report` writes `verify-report.json` for cohort grading. | `verify.ts` | Exercism results.json, GitHub Classroom |
| The README runs the finished system before any concept section. | `check.ts` 4 | Decoding AI courses, llm-twin #25 |
| Every bash block is followed by an `Expect:` line. | `check.ts` 4 | live-labs walkthrough |
| Model ids live only in `config/models`. Versions are pinned exactly. | `check.ts` 5 | anthropics/courses #71, philoagents #43 |
| Every failure message a learner can see is in `00-orientation/troubleshooting.md`. | `check.ts` 5 | Langfuse workshop #30, philoagents #31 |
| Every schedule covers every part, and its minutes add up. | `check.ts` 6 | RESEARCH.md |

## Checks test behaviour

A check runs the learner's command or calls their endpoint and judges the answer. It never imports their
functions, so any language or framework passes. Open-ended courses publish a small CLI or HTTP contract and
check scenarios against it.

## Run it

```bash
bun run check
```

Expect: `The repo meets the standard` and `Every check rejects its starter and wrong answers, and passes its solution.`
